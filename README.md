# Notes
Notes using markdown about markdown and anything else I want to jot down on GitHub. Probably will make this into a blog but I wanted to play with making a repo first.

Literally discovered the wiki tab after making this repo. But hey, this is all part of the larning process. and this is a safe repo to fail in.

## TODO
- [ ] Explore the wiki tab
- [x] Rename ``` JS Project Ideas ``` to ``` JS-Project-Ideas.md ``` so markdown works.
