# JS Project Ideas

## From [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app)

### Prompt
*I'm currently working through the JavaScript intermediate course on Sololearn.
What are some project ideas that I can work on to practice?*

### Answer
That's great you're working through the intermediate JavaScript course! Building projects is the best way to solidify your learning. Here are some project ideas, categorized by the concepts they reinforce, that are suitable for an intermediate level:

#### DOM Manipulation & Event Handling:
 * Interactive To-Do List:
   * Allow users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete.
   * Implement local storage to persist the list.
   * Add features like priority levels or due dates.
 * Simple Calculator:
   * Create a functional calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
   * Focus on handling user input and updating the display.
 * Image Gallery/Slider:
   * Dynamically display images from an array.
   * Add navigation buttons or automatic slideshow functionality.
   * Implement responsive design.
 * Dynamic Form Validation:
   * Create a form with various input types (text, email, password).
   * Use JavaScript to validate the form in real-time as the user types.
   * Provide clear error messages.
 * Color Palette Generator:
   * Generate random color palettes and display them as swatches.
   * Allow users to copy color codes to their clipboard.

#### Asynchronous JavaScript & APIs:
 * Weather App:
   * Use a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) to fetch and display weather data based on user input.
   * Handle API requests and display data dynamically.
 * Simple Movie Search App:
   * Use a movie database API (like OMDB) to search for movies.
   * Display search results with movie posters and details.
 * Joke Generator:
   * Use a joke API to fetch and display random jokes.
   * Allow the user to load a new joke with a button click.
 * Currency Converter:
   * Use a currency exchange rate API to convert between different currencies.
   * Allow the user to select the currencies and enter the amount.

#### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) & Data Structures:
 * Simple Game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Rock-Paper-Scissors):
   * Implement the game logic using objects and functions.
   * Focus on creating a clean and organized code structure.
 * Library Management System (Console-based or with a simple UI):
   * Create objects for books and users.
   * Implement functions for adding, borrowing, and returning books.
   * Store the data in an array or object.
 * Basic Blog System (Console or simple UI):
   * Create objects for blog posts, and allow users to add posts, edit posts, and delete posts.

#### Tips for Success:
 * Start Small: Break down large projects into smaller, manageable tasks.
 * Plan Your Project: Before coding, outline the features and functionality you want to implement.
 * Use Developer Tools: Learn to use your browser's developer console for debugging and inspecting elements.
 * Version Control (Git): Use Git to track your changes and revert to previous versions if needed.
 * Don't Be Afraid to Google: Search for solutions and examples when you encounter problems.
 * Refactor Your Code: Once your project is working, review and refactor your code to improve its readability and maintainability.
 * Deploy Your Project: If possible, deploy your project online to share it with others. Services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel are great for this.

By working on these projects, you'll gain valuable experience in applying the concepts you've learned and build a portfolio of your work. Good luck!
